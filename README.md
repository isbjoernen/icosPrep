# icosPrep
Discover data on the icos.eu carbon portal and prepare it for use in an atmospheric inversion model (e.g. LUMIA)

Provides a graphical user interface for setting up the configuration file for LUMIA. This includes an interface to the ICOS carbon portal and the interactive selection of observational data from the ICOS carbon portal icos.eu

icosPrep has been developped further from lumiaGUI and the lumiaDA branch of LUMIA (https://github.com/lumia-dev/lumia/tree/LumiaDA) project.
Its aim is to prepare all input data in an offline archive though with full documentatation of all persistent identifiers such that the data could be re-created at any moment.
